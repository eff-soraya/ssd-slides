    + Mention concept of easy to memorize but strong password. And not repeating.


    + Importance of having unique and random passwords

     (and moving toward passphrases)

    -computational strength to break passwords, why important for passwords to be long +easy to remember. solution? phrases. think 4-5 words.



    Passsphrases for immediate accounts that you need access to 



    Lesser accounts- password manager. benefit = generates random & unique ones. don't ahve to roll dice.
